# ML-Project
Stress Detection and Analysis in Social Media

This Project is part of the Course : **CS 584** (Machine Learning)

The Source Code includes the files for different Vectorizers : 
1. Count Vectorizer
2. TF-IDF Vectorizer
3. Word2Vec Embeddings

The *Dataset* folder includes the 'reddit data' CSV containing the posts of different subreddits.

The *Classifier* folder includes the model files which are used when running the notebooks. 

All of the python notebooks in the source code were run on **Google Colab**, because of GPU requirements.
The LSTM Model, particularly takes a bit longer time than other models.


There are three different jupyter notebooks implemented for each Vectorizer, which can be implemented in single file, but because of GPU and CPU constraints, it has split in different notebooks.

Collaborators 
1. Anjali Asnani : Responsible for the LSTM implementation and word2vec word embeddings.
2. Aditya Sharma : Responsible for the RCNN(Recurrent Convultional Neural Network) implementation along with Count and TF-IDF Vectorizer.
